- Trend indicators (▲ ▼) with color-coded changes
- Location-based pricing information
- Weather widget for procurement planning

### 3. Government Schemes Integration
**Roadmap Requirement**: Access to NMEO-OS and other state/federal subsidies. Push notifications on deadlines and eligibility.

**Implementation**:
✅ **Fully Implemented** in GovernmentSchemes component:
- Detailed information on NMEO-OS, PM-KISAN, PMFBY, and KCC
- Eligibility checking modals
- Benefit calculations
- Status tracking for enrolled schemes

### 4. Virtual Profitability Simulation
**Roadmap Requirement**: "What-if" scenarios: farmers can simulate crop decisions based on soil, weather, and market trends.

**Implementation**:
✅ **Fully Implemented** in ProfitSimulator component:
- Interactive form for crop selection and land area
- AI-powered profit calculations
- Visual comparison charts
- Personalized recommendations

### 5. Weather-based Advisory
**Roadmap Requirement**: AI-powered weather predictions, pest/disease alerts, irrigation recommendations.

**Implementation**:
✅ **Partially Implemented** in Dashboard component:
- Weather widget with current conditions
- Temperature, humidity, and wind speed data
- Location-based information

*Note: Full AI-powered predictions and pest alerts would require backend integration*

### 6. FPO and Buyer Linkages
**Roadmap Requirement**: Platform to connect farmers with FPOs and potential buyers to ensure assured market and reduce risk.

**Implementation**:
✅ **Fully Implemented** in MarketHub component:
- Verified FPO buyer listings
- Search and filter functionality
- Distance-based sorting
- Direct contact options

### 7. Gamification & Incentives

**Implementation**:
⚠️ **Partially Implemented**:
- Visual design supports gamification concepts
- Points and rewards system planned for future implementation
- Social sharing features in UI design

## Unique Selling Points (USPs) Implementation

### 1. AI-Powered Decision Engine
**Roadmap Requirement**: Uses predictive analytics to suggest the most profitable crop mix based on soil, climate, and historical data.

**Implementation**:
✅ **Partially Implemented**:
- Profit Simulator provides data-driven recommendations
- Visual comparisons based on market trends
- Full predictive analytics requires backend ML integration

### 2. Integrated Risk Mitigation Tools
**Roadmap Requirement**: Offers virtual crop insurance options and links with government procurement schemes to reduce financial risk.

**Implementation**:
✅ **Partially Implemented**:
- Government scheme integration provides risk mitigation
- Insurance information in relevant schemes (PMFBY)
- Full virtual insurance requires backend integration

### 3. Gamified Farmer Engagement
**Roadmap Requirement**: Points, badges, and rewards to encourage adherence to oilseed farming and adoption of best practices.

**Implementation**:
⚠️ **Partially Implemented**:
- UI design supports gamification
- Future implementation planned

### 4. Dynamic Profitability Simulation
**Roadmap Requirement**: Unlike traditional advisory apps, provides interactive "what-if" simulations tailored to each farmer's land and resources.

**Implementation**:
✅ **Fully Implemented**:
- Interactive Profit Simulator with personalized scenarios
- Real-time calculations based on user inputs
- Visual representations of results

### 5. Community-driven Knowledge Sharing
**Roadmap Requirement**: Enables farmers to share experiences, solutions, and success stories in a social-feed-like interface.

**Implementation**:
⚠️ **Partially Implemented**:
- UI design supports social features
- Future implementation planned
